#Description
This project will create a To-do list. Tired of forgetting your daily tasks? Well you're in luck! You can use this App to save all of your daily tasks! This app allows you to organize your pending tasks and your completed tasks.

The app contains a form that lets users submit a new task. Bored and can't think of anything to do? This app also generates a random task for you! So you always will have something to do. The app fetches the random task from the API https://www.boredapi.com/api/activity.
